									<br><br>
									Technical Lead of a 15-person team for customers at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB). The success of two previous applications
									led to the addition of a third, with development on all three continuing on a new contract. Established relationships with customers and subject matter
									experts, gathered and refined requirements and features, managed sprint planning and development tasks, briefed government project managers and customers on project status,
									set technical direction, and assisted with development and integration tasks.

									Technical Lead for a five-person project to operationalize a web-based application for analyzing large geospatial data sets for a customer at WPAFB.
									Used Angular, Python, Postgres, Docker, and a DC/OS-based solution for running algorithms on raster images. Worked with customers, gathered requirements, and managed the
									project plan and tasking. Developed a metadata extractor and implemented the integration between the application and the enterprise ElasticSearch data repository.
									<br><br>
									Technical task lead for Tau, an AngularJS application developed for an R&D customer at WPAFB that provided the ability to visualize weather and environmental data
									by rendering GeoTIFF images directly in a web browser. Built a metadata extractor in Go to load GeoTIFF metadata into ElasticSearch and a backend API in Python to 
									retrieve records and images for display in the web application.
									<br><br>
									Redesigned a geospatial image analysis system at WPAFB to support large-scale data storage and parallel processing using Spark, HDFS, and HBase.
									Investigated, benchmarked, and prototyped strategies for storing and querying millions of images and associated metadata and incorporated those results and
									lessons learned into a new version of the systemâ€™s backend API.
